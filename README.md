# Example of surrogate models for slope stability analysis
# Data is created from finite-element code (RS2)
# Example 1- analysis of max. vertical excavation depth
# Example 2- analysis of max. slope angle
# The X1 and Y1 files are the input and output data for the max. vertical excavation problem.
# The X2 and Y2 files are the input and output data for the max. slope angle problem.
# After downloading the files, the path to the files should be updated in the corresponding jupyter notebook files.
